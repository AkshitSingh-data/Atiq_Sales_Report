# Atiq_Sales_Report

In this project, I am showcasing my Power BI skills by presenting a sales report for a computer hardware company, Atliq Hardware. A video of the dashboard creation is available on the YouTube channel Codebasics, but I only used the data and created my own version of the dashboard. The data was pre-processed; I only performed some basic transformations, such as changing data types and extracting the month and year from the date.

The dataset contains four years of sales data (from 2017 to 2020) for 279 different products from both e-commerce and physical stores. Our aim was to visualize the entire dataset in the form of a Power BI report so that client can derive meaningful insights.

The KPI cards in the report provide an overall outline of the dataset and showcase the four most important figures that every client wants to see. From the table, we can conclude that Delhi NCR is the most profit-making city for the company. Additionally, by visualizing the line plot, we see that sum of profits has a lot of fluctuations compared to total sales. This is because, in some months, the company sold products that are less profitable, which is why we see the dip. The e-store dominates by covering 75% of total sales. The overall report is also filterable by year and region.
